## Introduction
In 2022 I became a member of the local Maker Space [makersLink](https://makerslink.se/), which I highly recommend to all the makers in Link√∂ping. I have done a couple of projects with my daughter, which are documented on [fatotesa.se](https://fatotesa.se/). The mechanical keyboard is the first non Fatotesa project. While hanging around the maker space, you get inspired and get all sorts of ideas and a couple of months ago, I thought it would be cool to build a mechanical keyboard with a wooden case.

## The cost
At first I thought I could build the keyboard from scratch. After looking into that I realized it would be much more work than I was willing to invest in the project as well as much more expensive than I expected. The cost of all the parts purchased separately ended up being around 1500SEK.

|Item|Price|
|----|-----|
|[PCB board](https://kbdfans.com/collections/pcb/products/dz60-60-pcb)|400SEK|
|[Stabilizers](https://kbdfans.com/products/cherry-original-pcb-stabilizers?_pos=3&_psq=stab&_ss=e&_v=1.0)|150SEK|
|[Keycaps](https://kbdfans.com/collections/keycaps/products/cherry-profile-pbt-simple-white-dye-subbed-keycaps-set)|400SEK|
|[Switches](https://kbdfans.com/collections/switches/products/cherry-rgb-red-linear-switches?_pos=7&_fid=ed1bbbd45&_ss=c)|250SEK|
[PCB foam](https://kbdfans.com/products/case-foam-collection?_pos=2&_sid=066eb7309&_ss=r)|100SEK|
|Shipping and Taxes|350SEK|
|Total|1650SEK|

I considered 1650SEK (~150USD) to be quite steep, especially considering that on black Friday one could get a full mechanical keyboard for under 300SEK (30USD).

### Svive Triton Mini

I ended up buying a [Svive Triton Mini](https://www.svive.gg/products/triton-rgb-mini-black/) for 299SEK (30USD) on black Friday. I knew nothing about the brand, but the keyboard has a PCB with a USB-C port, swappable RED switches and a Nordic layout and white keycaps. The case wasn't great, but that was the part I was going to replace.

Here is how the keyboard looked:

## The case

### CNC
This was the first time I would use a CNC machine, so it took some time to learn how to use the machine and the software.
I designed the case in [Easel](https://easel.inventables.com/), which is what we use with our CNC machine a the space. It's a simple, web based design editor that has a free and paid version. The free version has all the features I needed for this project.

I've published the Easel case design on [Inventables](https://www.inventables.com/projects/60-machanical-keyboard-case).

Since this was my first CNC project I used MDF for prototyping and testing. It took me 3 revisions in MDF and 2 in oak to get a result I was happy with.
