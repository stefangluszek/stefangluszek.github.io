title: "m/42 - Part 1 - The tressure hunt"
---

I have been a part of the [MakesLink](https://makerslink.se/) for a couple of years now. One of my very fist projects at the Maker Space was a bike restoration. I found a decent and modern Nishiki bike which was in a pretty bad shape and spent a couple of months restoring it. You can read more about the Fato-ðŸš² project on [fatotesa.se](https://fatotesa.se/2022/12/02/Fato-bike.html). Around the time I was finishing with the Fato-ðŸš² I was looking for a pair of used mountain touring cross country skies. I found a pair on [Blocket](https://blocket.se) and went to pick them up. Once I got to the barn to pick them up it turned out the guy selling them was also selling an old Huskqvarna Military Bike m/42. A couple of hours later I was back home with both the skies and my next project - the m/42.
