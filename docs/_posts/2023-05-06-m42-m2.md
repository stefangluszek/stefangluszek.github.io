I was searching the Internet for some spare parts for my m/42 bike and I came across an [auction](https://www.tradera.com/item/1000975/592722337/militarcykel-husqvarna-gammal-orenoverad-komplett) for another m/42.

I put the 50kr bid on the bike and to my surprise ended up winning the auction. So now I have two Husqvarna m/42 Military bikes. Since it's not particularly easy to find spare parts for these bikes, I'm going to use the second bike as a donor for parts if needed. Also it might come in handy as a reference when I'm putting the first bike back together.
