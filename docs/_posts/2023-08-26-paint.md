The summer is over and it's time to get back to business.

A while ago when visiting [Ikea](https://ikea.se) I noticed an interesting piece of furniture, a 179kr wardrobe which I thought could be used as a panting booth.

Since during the last [Fixar pass](https://makerslink.se/bli-makervard/) at the Makers Link we took down the previous painting booth, as it was taking too much space in the metal workshop and some people thought it was causing fire hazard, I decided to give the Ikea wardrobe a try.

It was much easier to put together than the previous booth which was based on a plastic greenhouse. It also took less space and could easily be put in a corner. It worked quite well, but it could be a bit bigger, especially at the top. I also had to make some holes in the bottom to let the air flow out through the exhaust fan.
