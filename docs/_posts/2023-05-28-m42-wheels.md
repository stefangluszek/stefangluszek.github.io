title: "m/42 - Part 4 - Rebuilding wheels"
---

The time has come to start working on the wheels.

The wheels were in a pretty bad shape, probably worst of all the parts. They were really rusty and the nipple threads where seized and impossible to adjust. I've never rebuilt wheels, but there is a first time for everything. I had to cut the nipples in order to get them out. The spokes used in the m/42 are non standard and much thicker (2.5mm) than your typical 2mm spokes and the nipples are of a different shape and size as well. I ended up getting Pillar Richman 2.4mm x 240mm and 2.4mm x 284mm. The nipples were still too thin and would fall through the rim and I had to use [Sapim Oval Washers](https://www.sapim.be/nipples/washers).

The most popular spoke lacing pattern used these days is the 3-cross patter. Meaning that each spoke crosses three other spokes on the way from the hub to the rim. But there is nothing usual about the m/42 and the spokes are laced in a 4-cross pattern. While you can lace your wheel any way you want when you are re-building it, I've already measured the lenght of the spokes for the 4-cross pattern, so that's what I went with. The spokes turned out to be a bit too long but I was able to grind the ends down to the right length.
