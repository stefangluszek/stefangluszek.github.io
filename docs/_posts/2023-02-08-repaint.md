When renovating my first bike I foolishly used a wet sandpaper, 800 grit, to remove the old paint and rust. Unsurprisingly this process took weeks and I had to take regular breaks to rebuild sanded skin on my hands. This time around the amount of rust on the bike made it obvious that a 800 grit sand paper wouldn't do it. I went to a local [Biltema](https://biltema.se) store and got angle grinder wire brushes. They worked really well and I manged to remove most of the rust and old pain in a matter of hours instead of weeks. I got [a set of 5 brushes](https://www.biltema.se/verktyg/slipning/stalborstar/stalborstsats-5-st-2000018767), but the one that worked the best was [the round 100mm brush](https://www.biltema.se/verktyg/slipning/stalborstar/axialborste-konisk-2000016904).

### Primer

Once the frame was clear of most of the rust and old paint it was time to prime it. I used the [Montana Primer](https://www.montana-cans.com/Montana-PRIMER-400ml-Metal/376320). It worked well, but if I ever do another bike restoration I will probably go for a two component primer and clear coat. They seem much more durable and resistant to scratches.
